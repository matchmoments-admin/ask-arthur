# Registrant-Intelligence — staged flag-activation runbook (handoff)

Activate the 2026-07-17 registrant-intelligence features **one flag at a time**,
verifying each on real prod data before the next. All are dark behind
default-OFF server flags; all are $0 (free-tier). Migrations v234–v237 are
already applied. This is a multi-day process — each flag needs a real enricher
run (or a manual invoke) to produce data.

**Three of the four flags are activatable. Step 2 (`FF_CLONE_WATCH_AU_REGISTRANT`)
is BLOCKED on sourcing** — measured 2026-07-17, zero `.au` clone alerts have ever
existed, so the flag is a no-op. See Step 2 for the evidence. Execute 1 → 3 → 4.

Owner: pick up here, execute top-to-bottom, tick the checklist. Don't flip more
than one flag per verification cycle.

## Ground state (verified 2026-07-17)

- **Master gate `FF_CLONE_WATCH_ATTRIBUTION` is already ON in prod** — the
  `clone-watch-enrich-attribution` cron runs daily at **13:30 UTC** and calls
  whoisjson ~32×/day (last call 13:33 UTC). So the four new flags will take
  effect on the next daily run once flipped; no master-gate blocker.
- The 4 new flags started OFF (absent from the Vercel prod env entirely):
  `FF_RDAP_LOOKUP`, `FF_CLONE_WATCH_AU_REGISTRANT`, `FF_CLONE_CAMPAIGNS`,
  `FF_CLONE_WATCH_KIT_PIVOTS`. **`FF_RDAP_LOOKUP` was set to `true` + redeployed
  on 2026-07-17 (Step 1 in progress).**
- Data available to verify against (2026-07-17): 1,085 enriched alerts awaiting
  campaign backfill (Step 3, ~3 runs at 500/run); 42 `likely_phishing` alerts in
  the 35-day window (Step 4); **0 `.au` alerts, ever (Step 2 blocked)**.
- The Vercel CLI in the repo is authenticated against the `ask-arthur` prod
  project, so `vercel env add` + `vercel redeploy <prod-url>` can do the flips —
  the Inngest "Invoke" click is the only genuinely manual part.
- whoisjson is at ~226 calls / 7 days — approaching its 1,000/mo free cap, so
  `FF_RDAP_LOOKUP` (first below) also relieves quota pressure.

## How to flip a server flag (each step)

These are bare `FF_*` (server-only) env vars, read at runtime via `readBoolEnv`.

1. Set on Vercel prod: `printf 'true' | vercel env add FF_<NAME> production`
   (or Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables → Production). Use
   `printf`, not `echo` — no trailing newline. (`readBoolEnv` trims anyway, but
   don't rely on it.) Confirm with `vercel env ls production | grep FF_<NAME>`.
2. **Redeploy** — env vars are injected at deploy; a running deployment won't
   see a new/changed var until a fresh deploy.

   **Gotcha (hit 2026-07-17): `vercel redeploy <url>` hangs and creates no
   deployment** on CLI 55.0.0, with or without `--non-interactive --no-wait`.
   It produces no output and no new deployment ever appears in `vercel ls`. Use
   one of these instead:
   - **Merge a PR to `main`** (the normal ship workflow) — the resulting prod
     deploy picks up the new env var. Cleanest: pair the flag flip with the
     docs/runbook commit that records it.
   - Vercel dashboard → Deployments → ⋯ → **Redeploy**.
   - An empty commit to `main` is NOT an option — `.claude/hooks/git-commit-guard.sh`
     blocks committing on `main`, by design.

3. Confirm the var is live: it should show in the next function invocation's env.

**Rollback (any flag):** set the var to `false` (or remove it) + redeploy. All
data written is additive JSONB / a nullable column — nothing to clean up; the
feature simply stops writing new values. No migration reversal needed.

## How to trigger the code path (don't just wait a day)

- The **enricher is cron-only (13:30 UTC), no manual-trigger event.** To run it
  on demand: Inngest dashboard → function `clone-watch-enrich-attribution` →
  **Invoke** (empty payload). Or wait for the 13:30 UTC daily tick.
- The upstream urlscan stages DO have manual triggers (rarely needed here):
  `shopfront/clone.urlscan-submit.manual-trigger.v1`,
  `shopfront/clone.urlscan-retrieve.manual-trigger.v1`,
  `shopfront/clone.lifecycle-recheck.manual-trigger.v1`.

## Pre-flip checklist — run BEFORE every flag (CLAUDE.md rule)

```
mcp__supabase__get_advisors  project_id=rquomhcgnodxzkhokwni  type=security
mcp__supabase__get_advisors  project_id=rquomhcgnodxzkhokwni  type=performance
```

```sql
-- Disk-IO budget top consumers (nothing new should dominate after a flip)
SELECT query, shared_blks_read + shared_blks_written AS io
FROM extensions.pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY io DESC LIMIT 25;
```

Baseline advisors today: only pre-existing INFO `rls_enabled_no_policy`. Any NEW
ERROR/WARN after a flip → roll the flag back and investigate.

## STEP 1 — `FF_RDAP_LOOKUP` (RDAP-first WHOIS)

**What it does:** clone-watch attribution resolves registrar/created/nameservers
via free unmetered RDAP first, whoisjson only when RDAP is empty. Adds
`whois.statuses` (clientHold/serverHold = registrar-suspended), `registrarIanaId`,
`abuseContact`. OFF ⇒ whoisjson-only (unchanged).

**Live-data pre-check (already done):** `rdap.org/domain/google.com` parses
correctly (registrar MarkMonitor, IANA 292, abuse contact, status array). The
parser is proven on real registry data.

Flip → redeploy → invoke the enricher (or wait for 13:30 UTC) → verify:

```sql
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE attribution->'whois'->>'source' = 'rdap')      AS via_rdap,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE attribution->'whois'->>'source' = 'whoisjson') AS via_whoisjson,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE jsonb_array_length(COALESCE(attribution->'whois'->'statuses','[]'::jsonb)) > 0) AS with_statuses
FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts
WHERE first_seen_at > now() - interval '2 days' AND attribution IS NOT NULL;
```

```sql
-- whoisjson volume should FALL, an rdap provider should appear
SELECT provider, count(*) FROM public.cost_telemetry
WHERE feature='whois' AND created_at > now() - interval '2 days' GROUP BY provider;
```

**PASS:** `via_rdap > 0`, a `provider='rdap'` cost row exists, whoisjson volume
drops on the next run. **WATCH:** if `via_rdap = 0` after a run, rdap.org may be
unreachable — the whoisjson fallback still works, but investigate before relying
on `statuses`.

- [ ] Flipped + redeployed
- [ ] Enricher ran; `via_rdap > 0`, statuses populate
- [ ] whoisjson volume dropped; advisors clean

---

## STEP 2 — `FF_CLONE_WATCH_AU_REGISTRANT` — **BLOCKED ON SOURCING, DO NOT FLIP**

**Status (measured 2026-07-17): this flag is a no-op. There is no `.au` data for
it to act on, and none has ever existed.** Flipping it would ship an
unverifiable flag. Skip this step and go to Step 3.

**The evidence.** `shopfront_clone_alerts` holds 1,526 rows, every one of them
`source = 'nrd'` (the whoisds newly-registered-domains feed). `.au` domains among
them: **zero, all time** — not "none in the 35-day window":

```sql
SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE candidate_domain LIKE '%.au') AS au_all_time,
       count(*) AS total
FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts;   -- → au_all_time = 0, total = 1526 (2026-07-17)
```

The feed's TLD mix is new-gTLD only — `.shop` (261), `.online` (191), `.com`
(175), `.xyz` (99), `.store` (71). The whoisds free tier carries no `.au` zone,
so the clone-watch lane structurally cannot produce an `.au` candidate.

**This is a sourcing gap, not a code defect.** The RDAP `.au` parser is verified
against live registry data (`telstra.com.au` → `auData_eligibility` carries the
registrant name + ABN 33051775556, extracted and checksum-validated), and the
v236 sole-trader PII gate is in place. The code is correct and dark; it simply
has no input. Tracked as a sourcing issue — an `.au` candidate lane (auDA zone
access, or the CT-log firehose already scoped as Phase B in ADR-0016) has to land
first.

**Re-entry criteria.** When `au_all_time > 0`, restore the original verification:
flip → redeploy → run enricher → check that `.au` alerts get an `au_registrant`
block with `abnStatus` ∈ active/cancelled/not-found/lookup-failed/no-abn,
spot-check one ABN against abr.business.gov.au, confirm `provider='auda-rdap'`
cost rows appear, and — the gate that matters — assert
`(attribution->'au_registrant' ? 'legalName')` is FALSE for any
individual/sole-trader. `ABN_LOOKUP_GUID` is already set (charity-check uses it).

- [ ] BLOCKED — do not flip until an `.au` candidate source exists

---

## STEP 3 — `FF_CLONE_CAMPAIGNS` (campaign fingerprinting + brand surface)

**What it does:** stamps `campaign_key` on each enriched alert (+ a self-draining
backfill of existing rows, 500/run) so the report card + `/api/brand-exposure`
teaser can surface "N of your lookalikes are one coordinated actor". $0.

Flip → redeploy → run enricher (a few times, or over a few days, to drain the
backfill) → verify:

```sql
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE campaign_key IS NOT NULL)                    AS stamped,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE campaign_key = 'insufficient')               AS insufficient,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE attribution IS NOT NULL AND campaign_key IS NULL) AS backfill_remaining
FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts;
-- A real campaign (>=2 domains one key) should appear for a targeted brand:
SELECT * FROM public.clone_campaigns_for_brand(
  (SELECT target_brand_normalized FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts
   WHERE campaign_key IS NOT NULL AND campaign_key <> 'insufficient'
   GROUP BY target_brand_normalized ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1),
  now() - interval '90 days', now());
```

**PASS:** `backfill_remaining` trends to 0 over a few runs; `clone_campaigns_for_brand`
returns ≥2-domain clusters. **Brand surface:** the next monthly report card
(`getCloneWatchReportCard`) `.campaigns` populates, and `POST /api/brand-exposure`
(with `FF_BRAND_EXPOSURE` on) returns a `campaigns: {count, largest}` block with
**no domain names**.

- [ ] Flipped + redeployed
- [ ] `backfill_remaining` draining; `clone_campaigns_for_brand` returns clusters
- [ ] brand-exposure teaser returns masked campaigns (no domain leak); advisors clean

---

## STEP 4 — `FF_CLONE_WATCH_KIT_PIVOTS` (urlscan kit siblings)

**What it does:** for confirmed `likely_phishing` clones, pivot the urlscan
Search API on the hosting IP → sibling kit deployments → `attribution.kit_siblings`.
Cap 10 searches/run, 429-aware. **Confirm urlscan search quota first:**
`GET https://urlscan.io/api/v1/quotas` with the account `URLSCAN_API_KEY` — the
`search` bucket must have headroom for ~10/day.

Flip → redeploy → run enricher → verify (need a `likely_phishing` clone):

```sql
SELECT id, candidate_domain,
       attribution->'kit_siblings'->>'reason'       AS reason,
       jsonb_array_length(COALESCE(attribution->'kit_siblings'->'siblings','[]'::jsonb)) AS siblings
FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts
WHERE urlscan_classification='likely_phishing'
  AND attribution ? 'kit_siblings'
  AND first_seen_at > now() - interval '35 days'
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20;
-- The worklist must DRAIN (no likely_phishing rows stuck without a kit_siblings block):
SELECT count(*) AS pending_pivot FROM public.shopfront_clone_alerts
WHERE urlscan_classification='likely_phishing' AND attribution IS NOT NULL
  AND attribution->'kit_siblings' IS NULL AND first_seen_at > now() - interval '35 days';
```

**PASS:** every processed row gets a `kit_siblings` block (siblings ≥ 0, or
`reason='no_ip'`); `pending_pivot` shrinks each run (op-review predicate holds).

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM public.cost_telemetry
WHERE feature='shopfront_clone_watch' AND operation='search'
  AND created_at > now() - interval '2 days';  -- <= 10/run
```

- [ ] urlscan search quota confirmed with headroom
- [ ] Flipped + redeployed
- [ ] `kit_siblings` written (incl. `no_ip` sentinel); `pending_pivot` draining
- [ ] search cost ≤ cap/run; advisors clean

---

## Cross-feature integration (after all four are on + stable)

The point of activating these is that they COMPLEMENT the brand outputs:

- [ ] Monthly report card / LinkedIn export shows the campaigns section (the
      "N coordinated campaigns" headline) — check the next `clone-watch:export`.
- [ ] `/api/brand-exposure` teaser returns masked `campaigns` for a cloned brand.
- [ ] Registrar `clientHold` status + abuse contact are visible in the attribution
      dossier (report card / brand-stewardship email consumers — future wiring).
- [ ] Weaponisation-risk score reflects `au_registrant.abnStatus` on `.au` alerts.

## Known follow-up (NOT blocking activation — dark until wired)

- **B2 (review):** kit_siblings are stored evidence but `computeCampaignKey` does
  not yet fold shared-IP overlap into campaign grouping — two clones from the
  same kit on the same IP but different registrar won't cluster. Enhancement:
  add hosting IP / sibling-overlap as a fingerprint component, or surface
  "shares a host with N phishing sites" on the dossier. Safe to defer.
- Surface `whois.statuses` (clientHold) + `abuseContact` + `au_registrant`
  cancelled-ABN line directly in the brand-stewardship email / report card slides
  (data is populated once the flags above are on; the render is the remaining bit).

## Emergency stop

Any flag misbehaving → set it `false` + redeploy (data is additive, no cleanup).
The shared `feature_brakes.shopfront_clone_outreach` operator kill-switch pauses
the whole enricher if needed. `SHOPFRONT_CLONE_OUTREACH_CAP_USD` ($5) is the cost
backstop (all these are $0 free-tier, so the cap shouldn't trip).
