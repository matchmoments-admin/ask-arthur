# Ask Arthur — Executive Summary

## Founder's Note

Australians lost over $3.1 billion to scams in 2022 (ACCC Scamwatch). The number has grown every year since. The people most at risk — older Australians, non-native English speakers, people in crisis — are the least equipped to identify increasingly sophisticated AI-generated scam messages.

Ask Arthur is Australia's first community-sourced scam intelligence platform. We give every Australian a free, instant way to check if a message is a scam — and we turn every check into threat intelligence that protects everyone else.

## The Product

**Consumer (Free)**: Paste a suspicious message or screenshot → get an instant AI verdict with plain-language explanation, red flags, and next steps. No signup, no data stored.

**B2B (Paid)**: Real-time Threat Intelligence API for banks, telcos, and fintechs. Aggregated, PII-scrubbed threat data showing what scams are trending, which brands are being impersonated, and which channels are being exploited.

## The Moat: Data Velocity

Every consumer check enriches our threat database. Every threat in the database improves our detection. This creates a **data flywheel** that accelerates with scale:

```
More users → More checks → More verified threats → Better detection → More users
                                    ↓
                          B2B threat intelligence
                          (banks, telcos, fintechs)
```

No competitor has this loop. Scamwatch relies on manual reports. Banks see only their own customers' data. We see the full picture, in real-time, across all channels.

## Market

- **TAM**: $3.1B+ lost to scams annually in Australia alone
- **SAM**: 130+ ADIs (banks, credit unions) required by APRA to monitor fraud
- **SOM**: Top 20 ADIs + 4 major telcos as initial B2B targets

## Revenue Model

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|---------|
| Free API | $0 | 100 calls/day, 7-day lookback |
| Pro API | $2,000/mo | 10K calls/day, 90-day lookback, webhooks |
| Enterprise | $5,000-15,000/mo | Unlimited, custom feeds, SLA, dedicated support |

**Target**: $50K-$200K ARR per ADI customer. 10 enterprise customers = $500K-$2M ARR.

## The Team

Building in public from Australia. Deep experience in AI/ML, cybersecurity, and consumer product.

## The Ask

**Seeking**: $500K-$1M pre-seed / seed round

**Use of funds**:
- 60% Engineering (threat detection pipeline, API platform, mobile app)
- 20% Go-to-market (bank partnerships, content marketing)
- 20% Operations (hosting, AI costs, compliance)

## Why Now

1. **AI-generated scams are exploding** — LLMs make phishing indistinguishable from real messages
2. **Australian government is investing** — Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2030, National Anti-Scam Centre
3. **Banks are under pressure** — APRA is tightening fraud reporting requirements
4. **No incumbent** — No Australian-focused, real-time scam intelligence platform exists

## Thesis: Sovereign Trust

Australian financial institutions face increasing pressure to use Australian-hosted, Australian-focused security tools. Ask Arthur is:
- **Australian-built and hosted** — no US data dependency
- **Privacy-first** — zero-knowledge architecture, no user accounts, PII scrubbing
- **Community-powered** — threat intelligence from real Australians, for Australians

This "sovereign trust" positioning makes us the natural choice for Australian ADIs navigating tightening data sovereignty requirements.
